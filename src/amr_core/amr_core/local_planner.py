Step 2 of the pipeline: Pure Pursuit waypoint following that outputs a
preferred velocity VECTOR instead of a differential-drive (v, omega)
command.

  Step 1 (navigator.py) - A* / D* Lite produces a waypoint path P
  Step 2 (this file)    - Pure Pursuit turns P into v_pref = (vx, vy)
  Step 3 (ORCA, external) - v_pref is fed into an ORCA collision
                            avoidance filter, which returns the actual
                            collision-free command to publish

This module expects an outer layer (a ROS2 node, a Zenoh subscriber,
or a test harness) to:

  - call on_odometry(...) whenever new pose data arrives
  - call on_path(waypoints) whenever navigator.py produces a new path
  - call step() at a fixed rate (10-20 Hz) from a timer
  - take the (vx, vy) step() returns and hand it to the ORCA filter,
    then publish ORCA's output to the actual motor/diff-drive layer
  - react to on_goal_reached firing, which is how cbba_agent.py learns
    the robot is free for the next bid
